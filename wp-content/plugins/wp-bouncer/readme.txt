Deter members from sharing login credentials: restrict simultaneous logins for the same user.

== Description ==

WP Bouncer restricts the number of simultaneous logins for the same WordPress user account. The plugin's goal is to deter people from sharing their login credentials for your site, which is especially important for a paid membership, premium content, or eLearning site.

### How WP Bouncer Protects Shared User Logins

* The plugin stores a random `FAKESESSID` for each user when they log in.
* If a user is logged in, on each page load (init hook), WP Bouncer checks if the `FAKESESSID` stored in the userâ€™s cookies is the same as the last login stored in a transient (`fakesessid_user_login`).
* If the two values do no match, WP Bouncer logs the user out and redirects them to the WordPress login page or a custom page using the wp_bouncer_redirect_url filter.

If the WP_BOUNCER_HEARTBEAT_CHECK is defined to true, JavaScript will be loaded to bounce users when a new user logs in with the same login. This is useful for sites with page caching.

Admininstrator accounts or any users with the "manage_options" capability are excluded from bounces.

### Or, Allow a Specific Number of Active Sessions

By default, WP Bouncer only allows one session per user. 

You can use this plugin to offer bulk memberships to corporate, education, or other group-type customers via a shared login.

Use the `wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins` filter to allow a defined number of active "sessions".

### Example Use Cases for WP Bouncer
* User A logs in as "user". Their `FAKESESSID`, say "SESSION_A" is stored in a WordPress option.
* User B logs in as "user". Their `FAKESESSID`, say "SESSION_B" is overwrites the stored WordPress option.
* User A tries to load a page on your site, WP Bouncer catches them and logs them out, redirecting them to the warning message.
* User B can browse around the site as normal... unless...
* User A logs in again as "user". Their `FAKESESSID`, "SESSION_A_v2" is stored in the WordPress option.
* Now user B would be logged out if they load another page.

### Hooks and Filters
* `wp_bouncer_ignore_admins` filter: if returning false even admins will be bounced.
* `wp_bouncer_redirect_url` filter: can be used to change the URL redirected to after being bounced.
* `wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins` filter: can be set to limit logins to a number other than 1. 0 means unlimited logins.
* `wp_bouncer_login_flag`: runs right before bouncing (can be used to potentially stop the bouncing).
* `wp_bouncer_session_ids` hook: used to filter session ids when saving them. Passes $session_ids, $old_session_ids (before any were removed/bounced), and the current user's ID as parameters.
* `wp_bouncer_session_length` hook: used to filter how long the session ids transients are set. This way, you can time the transients to expire at a specific time of day. Note that the transient is saved on every page load, so if you set it to 5 minutes, it's going to push it out 5 minutes on every page load. You should try to set it to (the number of seconds until midnight) or something like that.

We've found that using a 2-Factor-Authentication scheme on your site is a good way to keep people from sharing accounts. When we tried to design an advanced version of WP-Bouncer, it was basically 2FA. So try that.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed a typo.
* Tested up to WP 4.8

= 1.3 =
* Added a user action link (hover over a user on the users.php page in the dashboard) to reset all sessions for a user.

* Added wp_bouncer_session_length hook to filter how long the session ids transients are set. This way, you can time the transients to expire at a specific time of day.

You should try to set it to (the number of seconds until midnight) or something like that.

= 1.2 =
* Fixed some typos in the variables used to generate the session ids.

* Added wp_bouncer_ignore_admins filter, if returning false even admins will be bounced.
* Added wp_bouncer_redirect_url filter, which can be used to change the URL redirected to after being bounced.
